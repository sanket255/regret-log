# regret-log


Hey, you know how we all do dumb stuff sometimes — like sending a risky text or spending money we shouldn’t?
I made a tiny web app called Regret Recorder where you just write those regrets down. No judgment. It’s funny, honest, and kinda therapeutic.
Eventually, I want to take it further and let people lock these regrets on the blockchain — kinda like emotional NFTs.
But for now, it’s just a fun and simple space to reflect, laugh at yourself, and maybe… make fewer mistakes next time.
